Dear Jaslyn, every day with you is my new favourite. Thanks for being my home, my laughter, and my best friend. ðŸ’– Although we may be apart for a short time, it is just a small part of the time of our lives that we will spend forever together. I love you so much my cutie pie. So glad that we've been through the ups and downs and excited that soon we're getting married and will be a family. I promise to always love you and accompany you for shopping trips and food ventures

Dear Jaslyn,

Happy 3rd anniversary, my love. Every day with you becomes my new favourite, and even though weâ€™re apart right now, my heart feels closer to you than ever. Thank you for being my home, my laughter, and my best friend. ðŸ’–

This distance is only temporary, just a small chapter in the lifetime weâ€™ll spend together. Iâ€™m so grateful for the ups and downs weâ€™ve gone through, because theyâ€™ve only made us stronger. Soon, weâ€™ll be married and starting our forever as a familyâ€”and I couldnâ€™t be more excited.

I promise to always love you, to hold your hand through everything, and yes, to accompany you on every shopping trip and food adventure. Youâ€™ll always be my cutie pie, and I love you endlessly.

Always yours,
[Your Name]
